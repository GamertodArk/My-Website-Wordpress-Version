# Some Information
I have my own website built with pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, this repository contains the code of a WordPress theme based on my website.

And something I would like to point, **This is not a full Wordpress theme**. What I mean with this, is that this Theme does not show Posts, comments, custom Pages, etc. This theme only has two static pages and the WordPress part comes in the Customizer. 

I Built this Theme to be as customizable as It can be. Things like the color Schema, The page's text, the Website name, the description are fully customizable usin the WordPress' Customizer.

## Instalation

### Recomended Version
We are still talking about a WordPress and as I doub that you are going to find this theme somewhere else, the easiest way to get this theme, is to download this repository as a zip file. Go to

``` 
Clone or Download > Download Zip 
```

Then go to your Wordpress Dashboard and go to...

```
Appareance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme
```

And then upload the new theme that you just downloaded and you should be ready to go

### Using Git

To install this theme usin git, first run this command
```bash 
git clone git@github.com:GamertodArk/My-Website-Wordpress-Version.git
```

Then, insert that folder into a zip file and upload that file as described above
